PLAYING THE GAME (1 PLAYER)
---------------------------
This game is based on the classic game of
Hamgman, which is usually played with pen
and paper. Unfortunatly, modern life came
along and spawned this computerised version.
Anyway, here are the basic rules of Hangman.

To play, type 1 in the main menu, and then
type 1 in the number of players menu.

You get given a random word out of a list.
You won't see that word though, you'll see
something like this:   -----
The word is hidden. However, you have to try
and guess the word by suggesting letters. Like
this:

-----
Lives remaining - 14
 Guess a letter or whole word - 
[type in letter a]
--a--
Lives remaining - 14
 Guess a letter or whole word - a
[type in letter c]
c-a--
Lives remaining - 14
 Guess a letter or whole word - c
[*]
As well as suggesting letters, you can go
for the whole word as well:

[type in word 'coach']
c-a--
Lives remaining - 14
 Guess a letter or whole word - coach

You win!

And thats about it. In some word files there
can be 100s of words to play, so good luck!

---------------------------
PLAYING THE GAME (2 PLAYER)
---------------------------
You can also battle against your friends!
This is like the normal game, but your
opponent types in the word to play, and
you have to guess it!

To access 2 player play, type 1 in the main
menu and then type 2 in the number of players
menu.

The player selection will be based on the
player select settings. (see "Settings")
It will either let you choose who guesses,
picks it randomly or alternates the players.

First, the guessing player should leave the
room and the other player should type in the
word. The screen will be cleared. Then the
guessing player should return, and then
plays hangman! If he guesses the word, then
he/she wins. If he/she runs out of lives,
the other player wins!

SETTINGS
--------
There are various settings in this game. You
can access the settings by typing 2 into the
main menu.

DIFFICULTY
The first setting is the difficulty. There are
3 difficulties, all which change the amount of
lives you start with. There's 1, or easy, which
gives you 14 lives. There's 2, or normal, which
gives you the hangman standard of 10 lives. And
then there is 3, or hard, giving you only 7 lives
to work with.
[*]
WORDFILE DIRECTORY
This game can accept customised "word files". They
are simple text files with different hangman words
for you to play with. Add a custom work file into
the "wordfiles" folder. To select a file, just click
this setting and select the number that is displayed
next to your file in the settings.

PLAYER SELECT SETTINGS
You can also change how a player is selected in the
2 player mode. Type 1 to choose which player is
selected, type 2 for it to be random, or type 3 for
it to alternate with each game.
[*]
That is the Hangman help. Enjoy the game!
